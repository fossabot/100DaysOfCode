# 100DaysOfCode

I chose to commit to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, my goals for this challenge are that I improve my overall skillset in Java and C++ due to the fact that it is quite basic at the moment.  
Furthermore I want to get into the habit of coding everyday for a certain amount of time, I tried to do this multiple times in the past and failed, so I hope that this challenge will help me with this.

## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Push code everyday to this repository

### Day 1: September 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started to learn about different things in C++.  

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting to begin learning a new programming language, up until now I only worked with Java and a little bit of Python.  

**Links to work**: [datatypes, iostream, functions](https://github.com/Benzammour/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day01)

### Day 2: September 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about structs/classes as well as about linking files across multiple files and CMake.

**Thoughts**:  
The part about structs/classes was pretty straightfoward, as I had a course in university which covered C partially. So I was familiar with the structs concept and the background of Java got me to understand the classes concept instantly.  

The one thing I struggled for a bit was linking the files as I chose to write some code in one file and use it in another, g++ just told me that a certain problem arose while compiling but I didn't know what to make of it. I then had the idea of putting the whole thing into CLion (I get a free license from my university) and checking it out there.  

I then realized my mistake of not compiling the different files indiviually and THEN link them to one executable. As soon as I thought of that I tried it in CLion and it worked, but I wanted to make my own version so I checked out [how to use CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) (a tool I also learned of in my uni course) with this project and played around a little.  

Finally I got the hold of this and got it to work, I must say that I'm pretty proud of this accomplishment and also excited for what things are still to come in the future.

I chose to commit to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, my goals for this challenge are that I improve my overall skillset in Java and C++ due to the fact that it is quite basic at the moment.  
Furthermore I want to get into the habit of coding everyday for a certain amount of time, I tried to do this multiple times in the past and failed, so I hope that this challenge will help me with this.

## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Push code everyday to this repository

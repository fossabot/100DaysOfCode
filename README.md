# 100DaysOfCode

I chose to commit to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge, my goals for this challenge are that I improve my overall skillset in Java and C++ due to the fact that it is quite basic at the moment.  
Furthermore I want to get into the habit of coding everyday for a certain amount of time, I tried to do this multiple times in the past and failed, so I hope that this challenge will help me with this.

## Rules
1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Push code everyday to this repository

## Log

### Day 1: September 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started to learn about different things in C++.  

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting to begin learning a new programming language, up until now I only worked with Java and a little bit of Python.  

**Links to work**: [Different small programs](https://github.com/Benzammour/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day01)

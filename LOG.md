## Day 1: September 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started to learn about different things in C++.

**Thoughts**: It was really interesting to begin learning a new programming language, up until now I only worked with Java and a little bit of Python.

**Links to work**: [datatypes, iostream, functions](https://github.com/Benzammour/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/day01)

## Day 2: September 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about structs/classes as well as about linking files across multiple files and CMake.

**Thoughts**:
The part about structs/classes was pretty straightfoward, as I had a course in university which covered C partially. So I was familiar with the structs concept and the background of Java got me to understand the classes concept instantly.

The one thing I struggled for a bit was linking the files as I chose to write some code in one file and use it in another, g++ just told me that a certain problem arose while compiling but I didn't know what to make of it. I then had the idea of putting the whole thing into CLion (I get a free license from my university) and checking it out there.

I then realized my mistake of not compiling the different files indiviually and THEN link them to one executable. As soon as I thought of that I tried it in CLion and it worked, but I wanted to make my own version so I checked out [how to use CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) (a tool I also learned of in my uni course) with this project and played around a little.

Finally I got the hold of this and got it to work, I must say that I'm pretty proud of this accomplishment and also excited for what things are still to come in the future.

## Day 3: September 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: bool ? operator, calculate volume of a ball, casting, datatype limits/sizes  

**Thoughts**:  
Today I read up a little bit of basic stuff like the limits/sizes of different datatypes (they are relatively "basic" b/c of my knowledge of Java and basic knowledge of C).  

However I still learned a lot, especially about casting because I thought that the `(int) value` method wouldn't be outdated.

I also wrote a basic program that calculates the volume of a ball based on an inputted radius, with this I wanted to bring a few concepts of the last few days together to sophisticate them.
